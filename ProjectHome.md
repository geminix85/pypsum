# Pypsum #
### What is it? ###
Pypsum is a program written in the Python programming language that interfaces with [lipsum.com](http://lipsum.com) (courtesy of James Wilson) to generate Lorem Ipsum text, useful for template designing when lots of mock-up text is needed.

Pypsum actually consists of two programs, [pypsum.py](pypsum.md) and [pypsum-gtk.py](pypsumgtk.md).

### Getting Pypsum ###
Pypsum is available only for Linux, at the moment. On Linux, you will need python (I have 2.5.2, might work with other versions, too) with the following modules: urllib2, xml.sax (for the command line tool), gtk, gtk.glade (for the graphical interface). Most modern Linux distributions (like [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com)) have these ready installed.

You can get Pypsum from the Downloads tab, or, if you prefer, the Source tab. It's the same anyway, since it's written in Python and doesn't need any compiling.
