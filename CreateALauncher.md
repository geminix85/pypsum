# How to create a launcher (shortcut) for Pypsum #

**_Note:_** I'm using Ubuntu Linux, so this tutorial is made for that. It should be pretty much the same on any GNOME desktop. Don't know on KDE/Xfce/etc.

### Creating the launcher ###
If you want it on your desktop, right-click on your desktop and choose "Create Launcher...". If you want the application to appear under **Applications -> Accesories**, for example, here's what you have to do:
  * Right-click on **Applications** and choose **Edit Menus**
  * Go to **Accesories** and click on **New Item**

Either way, you'll get the same window. Click **Browse...** and select **pypsum-gtk.py**. It should look like this:

The **_lor_** icon can be found inside the downloaded package and is named pypsum.svg.
